    This website is an ongoing archive of thesis research by me <a href="https://emilybluedorn.com/" target="_blank">(Emily Bluedorn)</a> conducted at RISD in the 2023/2024 school year. My research centers around unpacking inheritance, or "the acquisition of a posession, condition, or trait from past generations."

                  <h3>In her piece, Signs of Love, Ree Morton unpacks the motifs of romance, translates them into new form with celastic and explodes them back out into the gallery space. I’m inspired by Morton’s handling of the traditionally ‘feminized’ topic of romantic love, and her attempt to explore, expand, and undercut some of these existing historic notions through materiality and generative transformation.</h3>

                  <h3>Esther Howland’s valentines are a remarkable collision of industrial production and hand-craft. Each valentine features symbolically rich motifs of historic romantic lore, and also delicately cut lace paper as a testament to printing innovation of the time. I’m also drawn to them for their excessive flourishes, and exaggerated sentimentality. They’re delightfully absurd and unabashed in their frilliness. In A History of Valentines, written by Ruth Web Lee in 1952, the author states: “The wheels of the machine age are vastly more rapid than girlish hands but the charm provided by the human touch has gone,” when describing the charm of heritage valentines. I’m interested in how design can be marked by girlish hands, and how that can be celebrated rather than dismissed as silly or saccharine.</h3>

                  <h3>In an interview with Sight & Sound Magazine, Robert Eggers states: “I’d rather sit in a carriage than in a spaceship. For me, the voices of the dead are a lot louder, and I’m interested in exploring who we are by going backwards. I wanted to make this archetypal New England horror story, and so the research really led my hand to what the film would eventually be.” Deeply invested in craft and atmosphere, Eggers constructed a film that pulls a viewer back in time, immersing them in the language, religion, dynamics, and hardships of the time period. What emerges is a story about the layered understandings and origins of American witches—the beliefs surrounding gender and morality that lie beneath them. A cultural excavation turned-horror film, The Witch gives no easy answers, demanding that the audience act in cooperation as archeologists.

                  <h3>A risograph zine inspired by the typography of 1930s pulp romance novels, <i>How to Live on Love</i> by Elizabeth Goodspeed is an amazingly playful historic exploration of genre, culture and craft. It also functions as a translation of a heritage style to the contemporary setting. It’s fun and visually compelling, but it also draws attention to American conceptions of romance, gender, morality, and love.

                  <h3>A collection of brooms and household objects, <i>Requiem Portraits</i> is a project by Barbara Broughel on display at Krakow Witkin Gallery in the fall of 2023. These artifacts each represent the story of a woman accused of witchcraft in Hartford, CT, the hometown of Broughel herself. Each object stands as a portrait, an investigation into the personhood of a life cut short from religious zealousness, intolerance, and fear. Broughel unpacks this American inheritance in her work, uncovering intimate truths from biased historical reports, and unpacking the horrible implications of witch mythology.

The exhibition originated as a counter exhibition to the RISD Museum’s Gorham Silver show. Ewald & Davis curated a set of artworks which question and problematize the legacy of the Gorham Manufacturing Company. They also hosted a panel at the event with community members and former employees, who have all been personally impacted by the legacy of the company’s material output.

                  <h3>Nat Pyper’s project <i>A Queer Year of Love Letters</i> is a collection of revival typefaces pulled from marginalized queer histories. Through this project, Pyper uncovers and translates buried histories, bringing fresh attention and form to them. Pyper states that their aim is to: “make the act of typing an act of remembering.” They also provide context to the intended use of the fonts: “In use, these fonts engage the past as a provocation. They engage the past as a verb.”

                  <h3>Laura Moseley, a textile artist, craft research,  and publisher, has run Common Thread Press out of the UK since 2019.  The press, “specializes in radical histories of crafts and making.” On their website they state that they: “publish zines, deliver workshops, and curate events that uplift the work of women, queer folk and POC through the histories of their creative work. Our publications are written collaboratively with early-career researchers, students and academics from all around the world, who share a love and interest in craft histories.” I came across this work through Inga Books, which carried Slow Grown, a publication on the history and practice of natural dyes. I’m very inspired by this collision of publishing, craft, radical history, feminist narrative, and design.

                  <h3>Slavs and Tatars, a design studio and art practice, showed a collection of work at the Venice Biennale, “May You Live in Interesting Times” in 2019. The particular works depicted here are from their <i>Tranny Tease</i> series. As summarized on the Tonya Bonakdar Gallery site, the work: “explores a unique instance of transliteration or alphabet politics. The bastardized polyglot cousins of Marcel Broothaers’ ‘Poèmes industriels,’ the Tranny Tease works address issues as diverse as power and identity and Polish nasal phonemes via the alphabets that accompany empires.” A politically charged pastiche, this series of plates uses symbols, language, and color to communicate inside jokes to those who speak the languages used. Their visually compelling aesthetic also elicits desire in those who do not speak the language to understand (I speak for myself here). In a remarkable talk at RISD in Fall 2023, Payam Sharifi, a co-founder of the collective, shared a perspective that their work functions as a ‘resuscitation of history’ that both respects and disrespects. He also stated that their philosophy is that art has to ‘dis-articulate,’ a sort of inverse translation of research and meaning to elicit feeling, or a more visceral understanding.

                  <h3>Ian Hamilton Finlay, the multi-disciplinary poet/publisher/gardener/gallerist/artist left behind a remarkable oeuvre of work. Famous for his personal estate-turned-garden and gallery, Hamilton Finlay was first and foremost a writer and poet, and worked with wordplay, allusions, pastiche and reference a great deal throughout his work. One particular piece, ‘The Great Piece of Turf’ (1975) is a direct homage to Albrecht Dürer’s 1503 watercolor ‘The Great Piece of Turf.’ Hamilton Finlay’s homage places an engraved stone with Dürer’s famous AD initial logo within a garden-scape replica of the original watercolor. Taking a new contemporary form of sculpture and photograph, Hamilton Finlay recreates the vivid scene as pastiche. He reached into the past, of inherited art history, and placed it concretely in the 20th century.

                  <h3>Re-envisioning historic women’s work / craft practices, Elaine Reichek utilizes the materiality of embroidery to create artworks that critique gender inequities. In her work, As She Likes It, Reichek excerpts language from Shakespearean texts in which women talk about their relationships with men. She prioritizes this female perspective, staging an intimate fireside chat within the study at the Art Gallery of Toronto in the Grange wing. The kicker is that the man who built this wing, Goldwin Smith, left his post at Cornell College to protest the admittance of women to the school. Yet, he inherited the home only through his wife’s inheritance… Reichek pulls upon this history, creating a philosophical tension within the space, a metaphorical, artistic middle finger to Smith.

                  <h3>Fred Wilson is well known for his work that unearths the archive, reaching into the past and revealing hidden narratives for greater contemporary understanding of power and inheritance. In 1994, Wilson produced a book capturing his project called Insight: in site: in sight: incite: memory, with the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. The SECCA’s “Artist and the Community” program tasked artists with creating work in response to Winston-Salem North Carolina. Wilson, who actually had ancestors within the town of Winston-Salem, uncovered histories of African American community and generated a collection of artistic works to communicate them. In this remarkable process of excavation and illumination, Fred Wilson pulls contemporary viewers back in time to reckon with the legacies of the past.

                  <h3>Issy Wood’s paintings read as otherworldly portals, but in her work, she primarily pulls on archival imagery and object studies. So, her work might exist as portals, but they lead to the past. In a series for her show Excuse Me / Your Life is Waiting, the artist specifically drew upon inherited items from her maternal grandmother. Artsy’s profile on Wood states that the painter, “envisions a dark world in which women have been battered by consumerism, heritage is turned into a transaction, and humor is as trenchant as a pair of gold teeth.” I’m endlessly inspired by Wood’s ability to unravel the façade of beauty to reveal the grotesque tension that lives within subtext and undertone.

This ongoing research project is documented on a webpage, as well as displayed in museum installations. <br><br>

                    Within this project, one of the figures Moreshin re-interprets is the laughing Snake. Pulled from 13th and 14th century texts, Moreshin redefines the snake as it relates to the complexity of female identity. <br><br>
                    
                    Moreshin defines her work as “re-figuring, a form of feminist and activist practice.” She defines this term as both “activation and preservation… an act of going back and retrieving the past.” She asks “how can we re-imagine another kind of present and future through re-imaging the past.

                  <h3>Marissa Zappas is a perfume maker based in New York. In her series Redamance Collection she draws upon the history of overlooked, influential women to create “olfactory portraits” of them, sharing their stories through multisensory experience. Zappas website states that: “this collection connects women across eras and honors perfume as an enabler of time travel.” I love this project because it taps into the multisensory nature of memory and our connection to the past. Every time I smell cherry flavor, I’m immediately transported back to sniffing my Disney’s Mulan chapstick in lower school. How can art incorporate this approach to pay homage to the past, and reckon with its complicated inheritances.

                  <h3>Bonnie Lucas’ art piece Spoiled (1986) is girlhood put through the ringer – pink, chiffon, lace, cartoon characters, neon type and baby bibs coalesce in a collection of the long lost items of to an assemblage of gendered youth. Lucas mines her own personal past, pulling from the 1950s and its material understanding of femininity. Lucas articulates this in her Harlan & Weaver profile: <br><br>

                    “Well, to quote one of my favorite book titles…. ‘I Never Promised You a Rose Garden’... I suppose the promise of traditional femininity is a rose garden. Instead of the garden my girls and women sometimes become roses with thorns and a future of being cut and displayed.” <br><br>
                    
                    I’m inspired by Lucas’ ability to pull from the myths of her youth to confront the harsher reality of adult identity and the cultural pressures it reveals.

                  <h3>“Everywhere there is splendor” is the name of Farah Al Qasimi’s installation which took place at the Contemporary Art Museum of St. Louis in 2021-2022. The museum beautiful summarizes her work with the following excerpt: “For her CAM exhibition she focuses on her personal family history through a lens of intimacy and interiority. In early 2021, during Al Qasimi’s time in quarantine after traveling to the United Arab Emirates, she photographed in and around her family home, referencing an old family album documenting their westward migration. She re-examined the significance of a personal archive, using the ubiquitous floral tablecloths, garments, wallpaper, and interior decor of her childhood. Reflecting on the past year and the uncertainty of the future, Al Qasimi found it ever more urgent to deepen her connection with her family’s past through these images, expanding on notions of cultural hybridity—living between multiple cultures—as well as ideas around labor and means of production in relation to her family history.” <br><br>

                    I’m inspired by the way Farah Al Qasimi uses photography and personal archive to collage larger cultural ideas together for her viewers.

      <div class="content">
        <div class="article">
          <div class="writing"><p>Signs of Love, a mixed-media installation by Ree Morton was produced in 1976. The work featured signature material deployment of celastic, a plasticky, moldable fabric in the shape of ladders, flowers, ribbons, and curtains. The installation also features graphic words strewn across the gallery walls: Atmospheres, pleasures, objects, and gestures. The line between designer and artist blurs in Morton’s often typographic and symbol-laden work. 

            I first encountered the work, in 2019 at the Whitney’s exhibition: Craft in Art, 1950-2019, where it made quite the impression on me. Freshly tenderized by the pain of first heartbreak and longing, I was immediately struck by its use of feminized symbology. Overwhelmed by the rarity of contemporary artwork to address a theme as sentimental, girlish, or maudlin as romantic love. My own darkest desire exploded across a white wall. The celestine symbols were roughly rendered, and there was a certain absurdity to the work. A recognition of a sentiment, but a self-acknowledged ridiculousness to all the notions of princes and princesses of fairytales (the work features two portraits depicting a prince and princess). 
            
            As I ventured into my thesis research, years later, I stumbled across this work again and wanted to learn more about it, dive deeper into critical analysis to understand why it resonated with me so deeply, my love for pink ribbons aside.  I came across Susan Richmond’s essay, The Sentimentality of Ree Morton’s ‘Signs of Love,’ which sharpened my understanding of the piece. The essay’s abstract identifies that Morton “engaged critically, and humorously, with its pejorative associations to kitsch, women’s mass culture, and so-called bad art.”
            
            I’m currently working on a project unpacking the symbolic and material qualities of 19th century lace paper valentines produced by Esther Howland, and I’m thinking a lot about Morton’s work. I’m absolutely enchanted by the gilded lace paper, and the ridiculous symbolic stickers of girls with straw baskets and birds in flight, and the text which reads impossibly like an ironic meme caption. One examples states: “U.R.Kind. I am Grateful.” 1800s text speak in print.
            
            My delight, while in part emerging from the frilly splendor of the objects, and their minute, endearing palm-size, is only part of what attracts me to the objects. The dissonance between contemporary mores and understandings of symbology draws me in as well. There’s a humor, a disbelief that such twee sentiments could be exchanged once without an ironic roll of the eyes or an ‘lol.’ Yet, the desperation for romantic and platonic connection persists, albeit embarrassingly. Perhaps, more than ever, as people swipe on apps, egged on only by their inextinguishable flame of home for connection, intimacy, miraculous love. I wonder what it means to address cultural cliches of romance in 2023, how symbolism is interpreted and employed in the age of post-print digital production. How much has changed between the era of gilded valentines and the one of unsolicited dick picks? A lot, but also not much at all?
            
            In Ruth Web Lee’s text, A History of Valentines, she writes the history of Esther Howland, as intertwined with the longer legacy of valentines themselves. She writes, “The wheels of the machine age are vastly more rapid than girlish hands but the charm provided by the human touch has gone.” (1952 page 56) I’d argue that she was wrong, they’re not gone, just transformed. 
            
            I’m interested in exploring the speed of transformation and mutation of symbols that the internet has rapidly accelerated. I’m curious how materiality can be digitally simulated to subvert symbology, to create a productive contradiction within the work. How print can be revived, and employed, in ongoing delight-inducing ways. How can Ruth Web Lee be proved wrong? How can design deploy the sentimental to evocative ends?
