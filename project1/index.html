      <div class=headline>Valentines: Signs of Love?</div>
    </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Signs of Love, a mixed-media installation by Ree Morton was produced in 1976. The work featured signature material deployment of celastic, a plasticky, moldable fabric in the shape of ladders, flowers, ribbons, and curtains. The installation also features graphic words strewn across the gallery walls: Atmospheres, pleasures, objects, and gestures. The line between designer and artist blurs in Morton’s often typographic and symbol-laden work. 

          I first encountered the work, in 2019 at the Whitney’s exhibition: Craft in Art, 1950-2019, where it made quite the impression on me. Freshly tenderized by the pain of first heartbreak and longing, I was immediately struck by its use of feminized symbology. Overwhelmed by the rarity of contemporary artwork to address a theme as sentimental, girlish, or maudlin as romantic love. My own darkest desire exploded across a white wall. The celestine symbols were roughly rendered, and there was a certain absurdity to the work. A recognition of a sentiment, but a self-acknowledged ridiculousness to all the notions of princes and princesses of fairytales (the work features two portraits depicting a prince and princess). 
          
          As I ventured into my thesis research, years later, I stumbled across this work again and wanted to learn more about it, dive deeper into critical analysis to understand why it resonated with me so deeply, my love for pink ribbons aside.  I came across Susan Richmond’s essay, The Sentimentality of Ree Morton’s ‘Signs of Love,’ which sharpened my understanding of the piece. The essay’s abstract identifies that Morton “engaged critically, and humorously, with its pejorative associations to kitsch, women’s mass culture, and so-called bad art.”
          
          I’m currently working on a project unpacking the symbolic and material qualities of 19th century lace paper valentines produced by Esther Howland, and I’m thinking a lot about Morton’s work. I’m absolutely enchanted by the gilded lace paper, and the ridiculous symbolic stickers of girls with straw baskets and birds in flight, and the text which reads impossibly like an ironic meme caption. One examples states: “U.R.Kind. I am Grateful.” 1800s text speak in print.
          
          My delight, while in part emerging from the frilly splendor of the objects, and their minute, endearing palm-size, is only part of what attracts me to the objects. The dissonance between contemporary mores and understandings of symbology draws me in as well. There’s a humor, a disbelief that such twee sentiments could be exchanged once without an ironic roll of the eyes or an ‘lol.’ Yet, the desperation for romantic and platonic connection persists, albeit embarrassingly. Perhaps, more than ever, as people swipe on apps, egged on only by their inextinguishable flame of home for connection, intimacy, miraculous love. I wonder what it means to address cultural cliches of romance in 2023, how symbolism is interpreted and employed in the age of post-print digital production. How much has changed between the era of gilded valentines and the one of unsolicited dick picks? A lot, but also not much at all?
          
          In Ruth Web Lee’s text, A History of Valentines, she writes the history of Esther Howland, as intertwined with the longer legacy of valentines themselves. She writes, “The wheels of the machine age are vastly more rapid than girlish hands but the charm provided by the human touch has gone.” (1952 page 56) I’d argue that she was wrong, they’re not gone, just transformed. 
          
          I’m interested in exploring the speed of transformation and mutation of symbols that the internet has rapidly accelerated. I’m curious how materiality can be digitally simulated to subvert symbology, to create a productive contradiction within the work. How print can be revived, and employed, in ongoing delight-inducing ways. How can Ruth Web Lee be proved wrong? How can design deploy the sentimental to evocative ends?
